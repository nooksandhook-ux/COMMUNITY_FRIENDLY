# Focus Lock UI Reminder - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### 1. Data Model Requirements ‚úÖ
- **Added `distraction_domains` field** to User model preferences.hook
- **Database migration function** updated to add field to existing users
- **Validation and cleaning** of domain inputs (max 20 domains, 100 chars each)

### 2. Backend Logic Requirements ‚úÖ
- **Management Route**: `POST /hook/update_distraction_list` - Add/edit/remove domains
- **Retrieval Route**: `GET /hook/get_distraction_list` - Get current domains
- **Settings Page**: `GET /hook/focus_lock_settings` - Dedicated settings interface
- **Session Start Delivery**: Enhanced `/hook/start_timer` to include domains in response

### 3. Frontend (UI/UX) Requirements ‚úÖ

## üîß How It Works

### Setup Process
1. User goes to Hook ‚Üí Focus Lock Settings
2. Enters distracting domains (e.g., "twitter.com, reddit.com")
3. Domains are cleaned and validated automatically
4. Settings are saved to user's preferences

### During Timer Sessions
1. User starts a work timer (not break timer)
2. Focus Lock widget appears at top of timer page
3. Shows message like "Stay focused! Avoid: twitter.com, reddit.com (+3 more)"
4. Message updates every 30 seconds with different random domains
5. User can dismiss for 5 minutes if needed
6. Widget disappears when timer ends or is cancelled

### Message Examples
- No domains: "Remember to avoid distracting sites during your focus session"
- 1-3 domains: "Stay focused! Avoid: twitter.com, reddit.com"
- 4+ domains: "Stay focused! Avoid: twitter.com, reddit.com, youtube.com (+2 more)"

## üß™ Testing Completed

### Logic Testing ‚úÖ
