## üîß How It Works

### Reading Session Flow
1. **Book Selection**: User clicks "Focus on This Book" on any book detail page
2. **Duration Choice**: Modal allows selection of focus duration (15-120 minutes)
3. **Session Start**: Hook timer starts with book pre-linked and task name set
4. **Focus Period**: User reads with Focus Lock reminders and timer tracking
5. **Progress Update**: Completion modal includes reading progress inputs
6. **Automatic Sync**: Book progress, reading session, and points all update automatically

### Bonus Point Calculation
```
Base Points = Duration √∑ 5 (1 point per 5 minutes)
Reading Bonus = Duration √∑ 10 (1 bonus point per 10 minutes of focused reading)
Productivity Bonus = Rating - 3 (-2 to +2)
Priority Bonus = Low: 0, Medium: 1, High: 2
Total = Base + Reading Bonus + Productivity + Priority
```

### Data Structure
```javascript
completed_task: {
    // Standard Hook fields
    user_id, task_name, duration, timer_type, category, completed_at,
    mood, productivity_rating, notes, pause_count, paused_time,
    
    // Hook-Nook integration fields
    linked_module: 'hook' | 'nook',
    linked_book_id: ObjectId | null,
    pages_read: Number,
    reading_progress: {
        start_page: Number,
        end_page: Number,
        pages_read: Number
    }
}
```
